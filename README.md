Wow. Just woah... okay, so Drop. It's like being inside a kaleidoscope but instead of colors, it's sound and a jumble of flashing images or maybe like being engulfed by floss, tight and confusing. First, the dude with the mustache, what's his name—Jacob? He keeps talking about time like he can bottle it up and open it later. I couldn’t help but think of how many patients I’ve had that kept asking about whitening like it’s going out of style when there he is, talking to a cat, a literal cat, who seems smarter than half the humans in the thing! 

Crumbs. They’re everywhere, down my shirt from all the popcorn I scarfed down, almost missing when that piano went crashing through the floor at the most random—like why was it there? It’s like the director went, “Let’s just add teeth flying in slow-motion, why not!” Actually impressed me more than that kid that visited last Wednesday with the sugar habit I can’t break.

Anyway, someone told me I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   but seeing it on a big screen with the sound just vibrating through my feet... different world. The other guy, in that ridiculous green hat—why a hat? He just felt like filler, right? But he had this line about gravity, comparing it to... ah, tooth decay or maybe just the slow drag of plaster falling?

And then the theater, jeez. Kids munching like cows on cud and the occasional cough that echoed every slow sentence. The seats ache my back worse than after those awful 5-hour procedures—had to stretch during credits rolling, couldn’t stay hunched anymore. 

Oh, remember when someone said to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   when you can, maybe at home, dunno if it holds the same clatter and bang there. Still, it’s like pulling out a molar, you might wanna be there for that.
